# CS50 TSE indexer

## Thomas Clark, CS50 Spring 2020

### Testing 'indexer'

To test the *indexer* I wrote a test program, testing.sh, to explore the capabilities of the program and ensure it properly catches errors.

The testing file first runs through improper command line usage and improper directories

### Test run

An example test run is in `testing.out`, built with

./testing.sh &> testing.out

In the file, one can see the ouptut of the testing commands, found in testing.sh

### Limitations

The program is unable to run on improperly formatted input files. Further outputs need to be sorted in order to properly compare two files.
