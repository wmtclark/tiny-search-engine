# CS50 TSE crawler

## Thomas Clark, CS50 Spring 2020

### Testing 'crawler'

To test the *crawler* I wrote a test program, testing.sh, to explore the capabilities of the program and ensure it properly catches errors.

The testing file first runs through improper command line usage and improper URL's/directories.

### Test run

An example test run is in `testing.out`, built with

./testing.sh &> testing.out

In the file, one can see the tested and inserted URL's alongside a count of pages printed to the directories.

### Limitations

Larger implementations (such as higher order wikipedia) were untested due to the time and computing power that they require.
